[{"title":"All Along The Watchtower - Bob Dylan","path":"//02/AllAlongTheWatchtower/","content":"Lyrics“There must be some way out of here,” said the joker to the thief “There’s too much confusion, I can’t get no relief Businessmen, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth None of them along the line know what any of it is worth” “No reason to get excited,” the thief, he kindly spoke “There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke But you and I, we’ve been through that, and this is not our fate So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late” All along the watchtower, princes kept the view While all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too Outside in the distance a wildcat did growl Two riders were approaching, the wind began to howl Trivia The song is written by Bob Dylan and is from his 8th studio album John Wesley Harding. In Electric Ladyland, Jimi Hendrix gave it another interpretation, and it has been used in dozens of films, including Forrest Gump, Rush, Zack Snyder’s Watchmen, and A Bronx Tale.","tags":["Music"]},{"title":"About Me","path":"//02/About/","content":"👋 About Me(Please don’t mind if my English is broken as English is my second language.) Lafcadia is my screen name (formerly ChuishenX, also known as Chuishen Qiusha (“吹神求杀”)), taken from the legendary writer Lafcadio Hearn. Learning in a foreign language School as a senior high student, I’m now the co-leader and president of Team OblivionOcean. I also have a personal blog based on Hexo where I post my “work”. I’m also openly bisexual. Most of my work is open-sourced and I published most of them on GitHub. Due to an accident with 2FA, my original account @ChuishenX is no longer used — however, most of the valuable content is transferred to this account. My closest colleagues are @Zhiro and @Fgaoxing. 📧 E-mail: &#99;&#104;&#x75;&#105;&#x73;&#104;&#101;&#110;&#x78;&#64;&#111;&#x62;&#x6c;&#105;&#x76;&#105;&#x6f;&#x6e;&#111;&#x63;&#101;&#x61;&#110;&#46;&#116;&#x6f;&#x70; (Public, Official) &#x7a;&#122;&#x78;&#48;&#x34;&#x30;&#x32;&#122;&#122;&#120;&#64;&#102;&#111;&#x78;&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109; (Private, Personal) My Favoured License: MIT License &amp; LGBTQIA-LICENSE.

I joined a little-known writing group (Xingluo Academy (whose website was written by me and I believe that it has stopped working for a long time)), and I suppose that the former members have forgotten it. In 2019, I started to build my first blog, the URL was https://chuishen.cf/. I just started using Hexo, and the only project I could think of at that time was “Du”. In 2020-2021, due to some personal issues, I quit the Internet. In 2022, I rebuilt the blog, and the domain is still used today. I met Fgaoxing online. I joined TongStarGe, which has sadly stopped operating, established Team OblivionOcean and became the president. In 2023, I entered Hangzhou Foreign Language School to study in high school. I also won the second prize in the VEX Robot Asia Open with the team. In 2024, I informally joined the Tianji Literary Society and served as a website administrator and author. I also created an English blog as an English counterpart of the Chinese one. Main Body of WorkLiteraryAll of them are in Chinese, so it would not be posted on this site.
